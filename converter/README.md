# 🔁 Converter - A **C** program

![Example-great](https://i.imgur.com/b3mlcoM.png)

### Example Input
```c
(G=kg, P=lbs, M=miles, K=km, C=celsius, F=fahrenheit)
Enter the magnitude and units: 20F

🌡  Temperature 20.00°F converts to -6.67°C
```
---

Converts **units** such as *kg to lbs*, *kilograms to miles*, *celsius to fahrenheit*.

Other conversions can be easily added by duplicating the conditions and adding more #define's to keep code clean 😉

Just compile it (gcc preferred), run it and enter your numbers.
